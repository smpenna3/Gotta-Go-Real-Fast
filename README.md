# Gotta-Go-Real-Fast
Sick and tired of boring controllers? 

This repository includes the necessary files to run Gotta Go Real Fast, or open it as a unity project.  All scenes, objects and scripts are included in the unity package which can be imported using Unity 5.  The game can be run on any windows computer by unzipping the folder and running the .exe present.  The game runs best in windowed mode, with slower graphics.
